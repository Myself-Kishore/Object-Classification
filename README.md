# Object-Classification
The aim of the project is to create a Machine learning model using Resnet50
model that is able to classify 3D point cloud data.

### Dataset:
The given dataset contains 3D point cloud dataset for 7 classes, namely, car, human
car, van, truck, car bike, sedan, human.

### ResNet50:

By directly learning strong feature representations from point cloud data,
deep learning approaches have been demonstrated to overcome several of these
issues. One of the classifying techniques for point cloud is ResNet 50.

A convolutional neural network with 50 layers is called ResNet-50. The
ImageNet database contains a pretrained version of the network that has been
trained on more than a million pictures.

The trained model can classify 3D cloud data into 7 classes.

### Encryption and decryption:

The encrypted data of the prediction is stored in OneM2M and decrypted while displaying it.
